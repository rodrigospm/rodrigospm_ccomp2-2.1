/* (MotorVehicle class) Create a class called MotorVehicle that represents a motor vehicle
using: make (type string), fuelType (type string), yearOfManufacture (type int), color (type string)

data members. Provide a set and a get function for each data member. Add a member function
called displayCarDetails that displays the five data members in five separate lines in the form
"member name: member value". Write a test program to demonstrate MotorVehicleâ€™s capabilities. */
